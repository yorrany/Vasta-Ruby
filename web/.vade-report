Implemented Vercel Web Analytics installation and configuration for Next.js (App Router).

## Summary
Successfully installed and configured Vercel Web Analytics for the Vasta Next.js project using the App Router architecture.

## Created Files
None - Only existing files were modified

## Modified Files
1. **web/app/layout.tsx** - Root layout file for the Next.js app
   - Added import: `import { Analytics } from "@vercel/analytics/next"`
   - Added component: `<Analytics />` inside the root layout's body, after the SpeedInsights component
   
2. **web/package.json** - Project dependencies
   - Added `@vercel/analytics: ^1.6.1` to dependencies

3. **web/package-lock.json** - NPM lock file
   - Updated to reflect the new @vercel/analytics package installation

## Implementation Details
- **Project Type**: App Router (Next.js 14.2.4)
- **Package Manager**: npm
- **Installation Method**: `npm install @vercel/analytics`
- **Component Location**: Root layout (app/layout.tsx) inside the body tag, after existing Vercel SpeedInsights component

## Verification Steps Completed
✓ Package installed successfully using npm
✓ Analytics component imported from '@vercel/analytics/next'
✓ Analytics component added to root layout in proper location
✓ ESLint linter ran successfully (no new errors introduced)
✓ Next.js build completed successfully (pre-existing Supabase warnings not related to Analytics changes)
✓ All changes committed to git with lock file updates

## Notes
- The project already had @vercel/speed-insights installed, so the Analytics component was added alongside it
- The Analytics component is placed inside the AuthProvider wrapper along with other tracking components
- All existing code structure and providers (ThemeProvider, AuthProvider, etc.) were preserved
- The implementation follows Vercel's recommended pattern for App Router projects
